-------------------
Dependecy Injection
-------------------


service wont be afffected by changes to its dependencies



-------------------
Dependecy inversion
-------------------
Code should be depend on absraction as opposed to concrete implementation

Benifits
easy to test

dependency can be swapped out for different implementation without modifying the service

code is cleaner, easier to modify

-------------------
Service lifetimes
-------------------
